   the life cycle of ndv occur entirely in the cytoplasm first ndv enter the cell cytoplasm via viral attachment and subsequent membrane fusion which be mediate by the hn and f protein respectively the viral nc or rnp complex be then release into the cytoplasm whereupon the rnp complex transcribe the viral rna to produce viral mrna which be then translate into viral protein genome replication occur when sufficient viral protein especially the n protein be synthesize the full length anti genomic rna plus strand serve as the template for synthesis of the viral rna genome minus strand the newly form genomic rnas be then encapsidate by the n protein before associate with the polymerase complex all viral component be then transport to the cell membrane where -PRON- be assemble into progeny virus particle the progeny acquire an envelope by bud under the direction of the m protein before be release from the cell surface by a process of detachment elution which be regulate by the hn protein which have neuraminidase activity because ndv be a negative sense single stranded rna virus a functional viral rnp complex be require for viral transcription and replication thus the reverse genetics technology use to generate recombinant ndv rndv require a fulllength complementary dna cdna clone and three helper plasmid encode the ndv n p and l protein under the transcriptional control of a t rna polymerase promoter     once simultaneously transfecte into permissive cell the three helper plasmid express the n p and l protein which then bind to genomic or anti genomic rna to form the rnp complex in general reverse genetic approach use to rescue rndv be base on one of three different system   a chicken fibroblast cell or qm cell line and fowl pox virus t recombinant system     a t rna polymerase express bsr t baby hamster kidney   cell clone system    or   a human epidermoid carcinoma hep   cell and a host restricted recombinant vaccinia virus modified vaccinia virus ankara mva system    fig   depict the reverse genetics system use in -PRON- own laboratory briefly hep   cell be infect with mva and then cotransfecte with a ndv cdna clone lasota backbone and three helper plasmid n p and l the recover virus be purify on hep   cell in a plaque assay and clone be select and passage several time in specific pathogen free spf embryonated chicken egg insertion of foreign gene into the full length cdna clone be a pivotal step for generate rndv express foreign antigen manipulate cdna clone to express foreign antigen must take several factor into account the foreign gene of interest should be synthesize as a transcription unit which comprise a gene start gs sequence the foreign gene and a gene end sequence fig    the transcription unit be then insert into a noncoding intergenic region of the ndv genome    the number of nucleotide that make up the rndv genome must follow the rule of six to ensure integrity of the genome and efficient virus replication the insertion site be one of the most important factor affect efficient expression of the foreign gene in general gene close to the   terminus be transcribe more abundantly than downstream gene the   to   transcription gradient due to imperfect restart of transcription at the gs in other word the foreign gene be express more abundantly and more efficiently when place closer to the   end of the genome    while the foreign gene can be place at any intergenic site within the ndv genome the pm intergenic site be prefer to ensure optimal expression of foreign gene     the length of the insert foreign gene also affect efficient expression of the foreign antigen incorporate a foreign gene increase the size of a genome and the number of transcriptional unit within that genome which often lead to retard growth of rndv in permissive cell    a single ndv vector can accommodate foreign gene up to   kb in length with a good degree of stability and express at least three different foreign gene     ndv vaccine strain infect many mammal but be very safe due to restricted host tropism nevertheless ndv be a strong stimulator of humoral and cellular immune response at both the local and systemic level -PRON- also have an adjuvant effect    importantly ndv be antigenically distinct from known paramyxovirus that infect mammal thus -PRON- be unlikely to be affect by pre exist immunity in mammal    ndv do not establish persistent infection in animal and human because -PRON- replicate only in the cytoplasm    in addition the rule of six mean that genetic change eg insertion deletion and recombination affect the integrity of the genome be rare    therefore ndv vaccine strain be potential virus vector that can be use to develop antigen delivery vaccine for use in animal andor human ndv vaccine have be use to develop antigen delivery vaccine for use in cattlesheep dogscat pig and horse table    antigen delivery vaccine for veterinary use include those that protect against bovine

vaccine to control and prevent nd conventional ndv vaccine be highly immunogenic and induce protective immunity in poultry importantly live attenuate ndv vaccine can be administrate in drinking water eye drop and spray and even via in ovo injection this make -PRON- possible to vaccinate poultry especially young bird on a large scale ndv vaccine can be combine with other poultry vaccine ie use as polyvalent vaccine to control economically important poultry disease the production of ndv vaccine be highly cost effective since -PRON- grow to very high titer in embryonate spf chicken egg and in cell culture this make ndv vaccine strain attractive as viral vector for the development of polyvalent vaccine against pathogen that could devastate the poultry industry    global epizootic episode of h hpaiv in wild bird and poultry and -PRON- potential to cause a pandemic in human have drive the development of effective h hpaiv vaccine    which aim to maintain food security and reduce viral load in the environment since the mid s vaccination program design to protect poultry from h hpaiv have be implement by several country in which the virus be enzootic include china and hong kong egypt indonesia and vietnam    in general conventional highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai vaccine for poultry comprise kill virus prepare from a low pathogenic strain or more recently from a reverse
